2.  **Phase 2: Core Components Exploration (30 min):** Research the main components: CPU (processor), RAM (memory), Storage (SSD/HDD), and Display. Understand their individual roles and how they contribute to performance. Use diagrams or simple explanations. 
3.  **Phase 3: Types and Use Cases (30 min):** Explore different categories of laptops (e.g., ultrabooks, gaming laptops, 2-in-1s, Chromebooks) and identify their typical use cases. Consider which type might best suit various needs (e.g., light browsing, professional work, creative tasks). 
4.  **Phase 4: Practical Application & Comparison (45 min):** Consider a hypothetical scenario (e.g., 'If I need a laptop for school, what features should I look for?').
